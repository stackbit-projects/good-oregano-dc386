      **Diagnose me** is a simulation game, meant for those of us who always
      wanted to be a doctor, but never had the chance.


      Learn how to recognize symptoms, collect family history, understand a
      patient's background and motivations so you could offer the best treatment
      for them. As the game progresses, more options open up and harder cases
      will appear.


      Join us in the development process and follow this unique game!
