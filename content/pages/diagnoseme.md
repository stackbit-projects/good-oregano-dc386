      **Diagnose me** is a simulation game, meant for those of us who always
      wanted to be a doctor, but never had the chance.


      Learn how to recognize symptoms, collect family history, understand a
      patient's background and motivations so you could offer the best treatment
      for them. 


      The game starts easy enough, where the choices are pretty simple. But, as
      the game progresses, more options open up and harder cases will appear.

      In advanced levels, admitting to the hospital won't be enough, you'll also
      have to give an **exact diagnosis**, and use collected data (tests,
      imaging, and research) to reach an exact conclusion of the patient's
      ailment.
