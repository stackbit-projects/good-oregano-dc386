      my wife on our first Single-player game - [Diagnose

      In this blog/site I'll document and share interesting projects, updates
      about the,  "diagnose me" game development process, and a bit of my
      experience being an avid developer and a gamer.


      I'll also, occasionally, remind the internet that I'm a **very** new & a
      happy dad
