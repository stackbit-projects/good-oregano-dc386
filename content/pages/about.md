I'm a Software and Game developer, an avid gamer, and a fresh Dad.

My professional experience consists of 4.5 years at IBM as a software developer, and now almost 2 years as a software  developer at Flipkart.com

Since being a developer was always a hobby of mine, during and after completing my CS degree, I've worked on many cool projects and games, one of them being a fun 2D platformer where I've used it to propose to my girlfriend (which is now my wife!)

I love building new things and developing platforms and games from scratch, I have touched many software development concepts, combined game development with Machine learning, and did many more cool things.
