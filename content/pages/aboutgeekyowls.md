We have a pretty short history!

We, Tzur & Nofar, are both gamers - Tzur is a software developer, Nofar is an Information Security researcher working toward her MSc in Neuroscience.

We both love playing games, but never really thought of trying to create them (even though, Tzur created a small platformer game in order to propose to Nofar!)

During the birth of our son, we had a cool game design idea. What started as a labor room talk to distract, became an actual game design doc, where several weeks after the initial shock of parenthood, we started developing it.

Quickly, we had a working game loop, and things are looking great!

[Join us](/diagnoseme/follow_us) in our cool journey!

Tzur & Nofar
