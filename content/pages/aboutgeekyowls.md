The short story of GeekyOwls is a unique one.

Tzur & Nofar, both gamers - Tzur is a software developer, Nofar is an Information Security researcher working toward her MSc in Neuroscience. 

They both love playing games, but never really thought of trying and creating them (even though, Tzur created a small platformer game in order to propose to Nofar!)
