So, these last few weeks were a blast.

We've used [MakeHuman ](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/)to create some models for our game. Although we plan the Alpha to be without any big animations and crazy models (just fun gameplay), we wanted to add some models so we could basically work on our modeling and animation skills.

We created 2 main characters - a Male and a Female (also 2 types of children, but animating them is still WIP)

The female and a GIF of her walk animation -

The Male - gif animation and close-up!

(not perfect, still WIP!)

We also added another Man, and another model of a Male carrying a small baby!

But honestly, animating the carried baby is huge work and we're still working on it.

The second man

These were all created by us with very little Blender and 3d knowledge! 



Another fun thing we added - custom events!

These events will be coded more in-depth as the game progresses, but currently - it's a simple coroutine triggered by specific events and values in the game. In the future, it will be created differently.

The new custom event - **Newspaper article!**

In case a misdiagnosed person is severely injured or required ICU aid, you will be held accountable by the press!

What's up next?!

1.  Visual overhaul. Since we feel the gameplay is somewhat solid, we're going to buy some new assets soon. They should give the game a more polished look and prepare it for the Alpha release!

2.  major UI changes

3.  **SKILL & TALENT TREE.** yes, progression is an important part of **Diagnose me,** but more on that in the future!
