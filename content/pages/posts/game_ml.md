### In case you don't want to read a post, there's also a Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/GycM61m3Em4)

A few months ago, I've started working on a simple game. I didn't want to play this game, but I wanted to build an AI that will learn how to play this game, and finish it (as well as other levels)

I sat down and started reading up on Neural Networks and their usage in machine learning problems, watched some videos for inspiration, and read some interesting books and posts about this subject. I'll link some resources at the end of this series, so sit tight, and enjoy!

# Basic stuff to know

Before we dive in - a short agenda for the next few posts on this subject, so this entire series of posts will be divided into several parts.

*   **What is machine learning** - I won't get into too much detail, just enough so you'll have the basic knowledge of what is going on

*   **What are Neural Networks**

*   **Evolution** - the connection to the ML learning process

*   **My AI's basic idea**

*   **The learning process**

*   **The final Neural Network**
