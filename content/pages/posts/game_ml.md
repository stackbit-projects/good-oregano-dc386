# Basic stuff to know

Before we dive in, I want to introduce an agenda. A way for me to separate all of the next posts and help you understand each part of the work I did.

So this entire series of posts will be divided into several parts.

*   What is machine learning - I won't get into too much detail, just enough so you'll have the basic knowledge on what is going on

*   What are Neural Networks

*   Evolution - and the connection to the ML learning process

*   My AI's basic idea

*   The learning process

*   The final Neural Network
