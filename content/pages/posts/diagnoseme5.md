Skills! we love skills!

In order to provide a sense of progression, we decided to add the **Skill Tree** feature to our game.

The reason is simple enough - A skill tree will not only give every run a unique experience, but it will also present fairly different gameplay in regards to the choices you make.

Currently, there are 3 main skill tree branches and another "Perks" branch. By choosing to specialize in the "Tests" branch, you will gain active skills you can use in each case, in order to get more information out of a patient. By choosing to unlock the "Specialization" branch or "Investigation" branch, you will receive a completely different set of skills - the "Specialization" branch will give you passive insight on cases related to the specialties you've unlocked, while "Investigation" will actually allow you to research into a patient's family history and much more stuff!

It's important to note that the skill tree UI is mostly in the alpha stage - meaning it will change and update to look a lot better. Right now, we're testing functionality and learning how to improves the gameplay.

By the time you collect 150 exp points, you've unlocked your first level of optional talents. Let's take a closer look at each of them and understand how will they help us diagnose better

## Testing branch - Blood Tests

**This skill's immediate effect will give you a new button in the patient's UI, and 2 new pages in the Doctor's Guide.**

This button will allow you to send a patient to some blood tests. When the results come back, you will be required to open up the Doctor's Guide and read up on the possible implications of the noted values, in order to understand what's going on and choose a good option for your patient.

The new UI button -

After you click the new button, this is an example result -

We get a result! Now we need to understand the meaning!

So we can open the Doctor's Guide, and try and understand what type of result this is, and how does it affect us.
