## Hello there!

I'm Tzur, and together with my wife Nofar, we are creating the amazing world of Diagnose Me (WIP title? maybe? we're still working on that!) a sim game that is intended as both a cool learning experience and a fun simulation where you play a physician in his daily life.

You will meet new patients every day, talk with them and hear their story, analyze their symptoms, and research their family history in order to choose the best course of treatment for them - whether they need to be hospitalized and check for physical issues, perhaps they need to be institutionalized, or maybe they are just faking it and should just go home.



After some time, you will always get to know what happened to your patients. Through the institute you chose to send them to, or In case you've sent them home - because you were sure they were faking it - through other means of communication, such as a news paper -
