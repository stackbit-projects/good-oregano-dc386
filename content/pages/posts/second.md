The first thing we did was take a decision to cut some content out. We understood that this couldn't be a "one instance" game, and we needed to divide it into levels. Now, we've established a progression system, aimed at new players to ease into the game. Instead of throwing data and hard cases, we let new players learn the ropes by playing simple cases with structured rules - rules that change and get tougher each time a level is completed.

On the technical side, we've added some new models we built using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).  We now have a patient model and a doctor model. Each of them contains different animations, and hopefully, in the future, they will look better.

We also animated them and added a new camera angle for the diagnosis part, so we feel the game is a lot more engaging now!

You can see an example gif here:

We also added full support of the Cases screen - you can now see the old cases you solved, and whether you were right or wrong about them!

you can see another example here -

As you can see, past cases now have a resolution, so you can learn from your mistakes and improve.

And on that topic, we've also added an important UI element - **the Doctor's Guide!**
This guide will help you understand what to do in each phase, and help point you in the right direction!

Also, we've added a brief gameplay intro, so you can actually understand what to do and how to play!

So, what's next?

The next steps are crucial steps, and they are divided into two major branches - tech and data.

*   On the Data side - we're hard at work and creating new cases. Nofar is collecting a ton of data and building cases that will help the players learn. Each new case will give a player some important information, that could help with future cases!

*   On the technical side, we're working on fixing the last issues before releasing the first 2 levels to friends and family as the **alpha** stage of the game. They contain all the base features we feel are needed, and in parallel, we'll continue adding more models and creating more features. This does not mean we're close to being done - we just want to make sure the base gameplay is fun so when we push forward to the Beta stage of the game (that stage will contain **a lot of features** and **gameplay mechanics**), we'll be certain it's fun.

We'll keep you posted, until next time!
