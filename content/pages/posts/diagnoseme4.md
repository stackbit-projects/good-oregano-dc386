After a massive research on Nofar's side, we've managed to get some very cool graphical elements - UI & 3D models!

After the basic game systems worked, we realized we now need some nice visuals to go along with our alpha version.

As you already know, Nofar designed the 3d models and then searched for matching assets to go along with the humans she created using MakeHuman.

After some time, she found a very cool asset pack, which we combined with other office-oriented asset packs and created our first level. As this is still an alpha version, this won't be the final visuals. But it's important to give the first alpha testers that will play the game a good sense of how it should look at the end, and we are pleased with the current result.

Yes, it will probably change a lot in the future. But still, you gotta admire the vision!

Also, we added some very cool animations!

Using Mixamo and some custom animations (Blender is cool!), we've created some very cool animations!

Here's a quick gif that shows off some cool graphics!
